Title or name of research/training: 
    Spotify API Research

Why you are doing it: 
    Need to understand what metrics are applied to individual songs and how we can use those metrics.

What you expect to learn/do.
    From the research gathered, I plan to implement the user options within the U/I and also informing my teamates
    on what direction we will be going with the playlist customization. 

What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.  Be specific.  For example, "Writing the UI" is not sufficient.   "Writing the Login class" is.
    From the metrics given, we aim to integrate them through user preferences. This will allow us to generate 
    the custom playlist. 

What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training.: 
    "Define 'buckets' for playlist sorting" Using the metrics we are able to gather, we will define types of playlist users can generate from their music.
    Furthemore, in the next sprint this information will be used for algorithm design.
