1.	React Research/Foundations
2.	I have never used React before and need some basic understanding of syntax and how it is used to create the frontend. I do have experience with HTML, CSS, Typescript, and the idea of components already because I have used Angular.
3.	I expect to know how components are structured and how to pass information to them. 
4.  I expect to better understand the syntax of react and this will be used when I am creating the main page for our app to allow a user to import songs, view their imported playlists, and other features to come.
5.	Task SCRUM-85, 76, 79 for this sprint.

React (and some JavaScript) Notes

React is component based - Function or Class components.
Function Components: Typically used when they state management is not needed or lifecycle methods, but becoming more common now due to their simplicity.
Function Components can use things like useState and useEffect to handle state effects more easily
Class Components: Extend React.Component class but can extend other components too, more commonly used for state management lifecycle and lifecycle methods (ex. componentDidMount(): called right after component is rendered for the first time)
Components can only change their internal state, not their properties
Props/state input, UI output
Virtual views in memory make it fast and responsive, diffs between virtual dom and inputs and only updates what has changed
Functions that use an await need to be labeled async
Async <=> asynchronous, meaning some sort of request that brings back a response. Response comes back in the form of a promise.
Can deserialize a response into json by using .json on whatever variable you used to capture the response. You must await the deserialization too.


Example of some React code (using function components) I worked on with a tutorial that was in React 17. Rendering & some slight syntax change and rendering would be done using root.render for react18.

function Button(props) {
  const handleClick = () => props.onClickFunction(props.increment);
	return (
  	<button onClick={handleClick}>
      +{props.increment}
    </button>
  );
}

function Display(props) {
	return (
  	<div>{props.message}</div>
  );
}

function App() {
	const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const incrementCounter = (incrementValue) => setCounter(counter+incrementValue);
	return (
    <div>
      <Button onClickFunction={incrementCounter} increment={1} />
      <Button onClickFunction={incrementCounter} increment={5} />
      <Button onClickFunction={incrementCounter} increment={10} />
      <Button onClickFunction={incrementCounter} increment={100} />
      <Display message={counter}/>
    </div>  
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />, 
  document.getElementById('mountNode'),
);
