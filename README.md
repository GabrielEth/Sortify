## General Information
- Moodify is an app intended to be used in conjunction with Spotify to create personalized playlists tailored to your desired mood and other related song features. 
- The app is being created for spotify users who want more options for creating playlists based on music they already have. Songs will be pulled from a user's liked songs in their library rather than finding new music.
- We are creating this app with the intent to provide more customization with creating spotify playlists. This will save spotify users a lot of time and provide new types of playlists for them to listen to.
